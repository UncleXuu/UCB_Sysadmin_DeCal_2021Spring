## Shell spelunker
3. Use `cd` to change directory, use `pwd` to print current path.
4. Use `ls-a` to find out all the hidden files (whose name start with `.`).
5. Use `ls | xarg cat` where | pipes ls into xarg and xarg pass ls as arguments into cat.
6. `rm /path/to/directory/*` if you are already inside the directory, use `rm *`
7. `grep -C 2 'https' big_data.txt` # use `grep` to find the line which contains 'https' and `-B n` to catch n lines above. In addition `-A n` is to catch n lines below, `-C n` is to catch n lines above and below.
8. Require 'execute' permission, use `chmod +x ./a_script`. # use `ls -l` to check permission
9. `echo UncleXuu >> hello_world`

## General questions
1. They are UNIX-like systems.
2. CLI is powerful and efficient while GUI is more user-friendly.
3. The root directory is the top-most directory in the hierarchical filesystem, the start point of the filesystem.
4. `ls -ltrh`
5. `head -n 4`
6. `cat a > b` read file a and overwrite int in file b `cat a >> b` read and append.

## Cultural questions
1. permissive licenses allow you almost do everything while copyleft licenses allow you use it under some conditions.
2. MIT license
3. (a) UTM (b) Visual Studio
